This package includes the following files:

     RADriver.da            - This is the driver program for Ricart Agrawala
     RAToken.da             - This is the process class for Ricart Agrawala algorithm implementation
     SKDriver.da            - This is the driver program for Suzuki Kasami

     README                 - This file
     

USAGE:
------

To execute the program

1. Ricart Agrawala Algorithm
   --------------------------
    
    python -m distalgo.runtime RADriver.da -d <<directory>> -p <<noOfProcess>> <<noOfRequests>>
    
    where,
    << directory >>   - indicates the location of the source files.
    << noOfProcess>>  - indicates the no of processes to be executed.
    << noOfRequests>> - indicates the total number of requests to be executed by all processes.
    
    eg:
    
    python3.2 -m distalgo.runtime RADriver.da -d "/home/sivaranjini/Documents/DistAlgo-0.3" -p 10 20
    

2. Suzuki Kasami Algorithm
   -----------------------

    python -m distalgo.runtime SKDriver.da -d <<directory>> -p <<noOfProcess>> <<noOfRequests>>
    
    where,
    << directory >>   - indicates the location of the source files.
    << noOfProcess>>  - indicates the no of processes to be executed.
    << noOfRequests>> - indicates the total number of requests to be executed by all processes.
    
    eg:
    
    python3.2 -m distalgo.runtime SKDriver.da -d "/home/sivaranjini/Documents/DistAlgo-0.3" -p 10 20

    
OBSERVATIONS
------------

1. I had initially completed my assignment in DistAlgo-0.1, where the log file when specified --logfile <<filename>> it did create the log file.
   But, in DistAlgo-0.3, the log file was not created for the filename specified.
